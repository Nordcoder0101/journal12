Journal 12

Today was a reality check for me.  I had looked at my grade previous to my discussion with Brian and it made me a little
upset with myself.  I have been working really hard on the JavaScript side of things and let so much fall by the wayside 
outside of coding.  I have made a concerted effort tonight to catch up on all these holes in my grade.  I want to do 
everything I can to pass this class, at least that way if I don't pass, I know that I did what I could to make up for my
mistakes.

I am glad I have a relatively light weekend to turn in any outstanding coding/css projects that might not be fully complete.

Either way, I am really excited to get to work on project week.  We have a great group and our website hits close to 
home for one of my all time passions... board games!!!
